## Eschatology

What will we study in the Eschatology Unit?

Despite being a new and complex-sounding RE key term, eschatology is not as difficult to define as it first appears. The root of the word eschatology means 'study of the last things,' which means studying what will happen at the end of the world. You might have already heard beliefs about The Last Judgement, a future event when Jesus returns, 'in glory, to judge and the dead.'

In this unit you will be learning;

* What the Bible and the Catholic Church teaches about the end of the World.
* What the Bible and the Catholic Church teaches about the afterlife.
* What sacraments exist to support those who are sick and/ or dying.
* What happens during Catholic Funerals and why.
* About two forms of expression (objects/ art that express belief): The Paschal Candle and Michelangelo's painting, 'The Last Judgement.'
* About the moral and religious arguments surrounding the care of the dying and euthanasia.

This is the final unit of the Catholic Christianity section and is the final piece of the Catholic Jigsaw of Theology. After this, you should be able to make links between all 6 units.
